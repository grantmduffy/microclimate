# Microclimate
Welcome to microclimate, the climate simulation sandbox game! Run it in your browser [here](https://grantmduffy.github.io/microclimate/microclimate.html)

The controls are as follows:
- left click: pen (effect depends on pen type)
- CTRL + left click: move
- SHIFT + left click: look around
- ALT + left click: change elevation

This simulation run completely on your GPU using WebGL. Simulation dynamics that are implemented or are in progress include:
- [x] air fluid dynamics
- [x] air-terrain interraction
- [x] thermal convection
- [x] thermodynamic inputs/outputs
- [x] humidity convection
- [x] hillshading
- [x] cloud condensation
- [x] volumetric sun ray tracing
- [x] shaddow mapping
- [x] screen-space volumetric rendering
- [x] precipitation (simulation)
- [x] precipitation (rendering)
- [x] rainbows
- [x] surface water flow
- [x] freezing temp
